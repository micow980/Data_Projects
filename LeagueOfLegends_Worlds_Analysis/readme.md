This project contains the works I have utilized in order to create a report looking at the data across the Popular Game League of Legends.

My goal in this analysis is to look at the Champions Riot Games would consider to need a nerf or buff.

From the list of champions and criteria for riot to involve a change to their champions, I will be analyzing data collected during Patch 12.18. This is the patch in which Worlds was played on.

With this project my hope is to be able to understand what champions needed to be nerfed or buffed at the end of Patch 12.18.

I will then take the list of champions that needed to be nerfed and see if these champions were utilized on the grand stage of League of Legends and see if they assisted in helping the team win a championship title.
