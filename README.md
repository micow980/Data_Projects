# Data Analysis Projects Covering the fundamental analysis topics I believe are important to the average Data Scientist or Analyst. 

## I tried to focus solely on being able to pull the data and relabel some variables while adding some graphs showing some relationships between the data

## Inside this repository there is a practice analysis where I test out different features of the library packages I used and an analysis where I report my findings

### I will be covering univariate data analysis, multivariate data analysis and some machine learning techniques I have been practicing.
