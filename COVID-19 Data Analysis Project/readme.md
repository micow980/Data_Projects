This project will be my first project where I will be utilizing  SQL and Tableau to conduct an exploratory data analysis project on COVID-19 to try to discover any trends during the pandemic and whether the procedures taken by the United States were on par with other countries. During the shutdown there was many speculations on whether the country could have done more to protect their people. My goal is to be able to intake in the COVID-19 Deaths data presented by Our World https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths a COVID-19 centralized database that updates their data from global input.
